Description:
I created this theme for my wordpress 1.2 blog and when I decided to upgrade to 1.3 I ported it. So, it's kind of hacked together, but it works nonetheless.

Installation:
Just copy the Conestogastreet folder into wp-content/themes and activate it from the Presentation menu in wp-admin, done.

Modification:
There are two images to modify, your profile image and the header image for the blog. Modify at your discretion. If you like the font I used for the header image, it's called "Felix Titling." I set the color to black and put a 90 degree drop shadow with a 0 distance and set  50 % opacity. I wouldn't change the width of either image, but do what you want to the height.

Enjoy.
